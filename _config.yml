storyTitle: "The story of BANTR:"
story1: The Gibson Ek Buddy Program is a program that was started by a student, to pair freshmen with an older buddy to help them adjust to the new school. This student individually paired up every single pair of buddies based on a survey of their interests, to make compatible matches. I saw this and thought, "I could program something to make this process so much easier"!
